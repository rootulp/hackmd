# Flipper x CRISP in Cairo
## Goals
1. Submit and demo a project for EthAmsterdam
2. Learn something new 

No intention to make money or win a prize. I can promise we'll have fun learning along the way.

## Project idea
Use [Flipper](https://github.com/Anish-Agnihotri/flipper) to download an existing NFT collection (ex. [nouns](https://nouns.wtf/)) and flip images. Then list them via [CRISP](https://github.com/FrankieIsLost/CRISP) targeting a one sale per day rate. We can deploy this to StarkNet testnet and learn more about [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/) in the process.

## Back-end
We need one back-end dev to get familiar with [Flipper](https://github.com/Anish-Agnihotri/flipper) and use it to download, flip, and upload NFT metadata for an existing NFT collection. We probably only need 100 NFTs for V0.

We need another one or two back-end dev(s) to get familiar with Cairo, [starknet-erc721](https://github.com/l-henri/starknet-erc721), and be responsible for creating the NFTs on Starknet.

## Front-end
Our V0 can have no front-end at all. We can mint NFTs via [Voyager](https://voyager.online/). If we do this, we'll want to make sure our NFTs can be viewed in [Oasis](https://testnet.playoasis.xyz/) for demo.

If we have a dedicated front-end dev, we can explore creating a landing page where user's can mint an NFT from. We may want to use [starknet-react](https://github.com/auclantis/starknet-react) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).
